Command to scaffold from existing DB:

Scaffold-DbContext -Connection "Server=DESKTOP-3RECD67\SQLEXPRESS; Database=angularTutorial; Trusted_Connection=True; MultipleActiveResultSets=true;" -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir "Models" -ContextDir "Data" -Context "FootballDbContext" -NoOnConfiguring


Trouble shooting:

----

For me apparently it worked once I have also ran in Package Manager console :

 	Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools 

Also make sure :

To have other dependencies (for example Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design...) referenced depending of your needs.

To select the right assembly as target for your commands in the top-right corner of the PM console (I am frequently fooled by forgetting it...)

----

Unable to find provider assembly 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer'. Ensure the name is correct and it's referenced by the project.

The fix as mentioned was to add the SQL framework. You can add it very quickly via the package manager console using:

	Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
